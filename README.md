Oxipital, visual instrument

![Oxipital Logo](https://github.com/Gamgie/Oxipital/blob/master/Communication/Oxipital.Logo.png)

It is currently controlled by a Akai MPD218 and Novation Laynchpad XL.

Unity handles particles and rendering with VFX Graph.

Touch Designer handle audio capture and management. It also apply some process on Unity image. I also use to it video project on other screens.

Chataigne create the link between all this. Receive MIDI message and dispatch everything to others. Dashboards are the main UI of the instrument.
